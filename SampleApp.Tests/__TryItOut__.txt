There are a number of conventions setup in this project, to try convention tests out, simply violate a convention, then run the tests.

Some examples:

 - Create a class ending in Dto outside the Dto namespace
 - Add a non-virtual method to the domain class
 - Make the domain class constructor private
 - Change the SqlScripts\Script0001.sql file build action to Content (rather than EmbeddedResource)
 - Create an API Controller where you incorrectly spell 'Controller'

These are some of the examples of conventions which are easily put in place with convention tests!
